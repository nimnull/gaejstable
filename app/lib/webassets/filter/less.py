    """Converts `Less <http://lesscss.org/>`_ markup to real CSS.

    Only works with versions 1.x of the less gem. 2.x do not yet support
    command line invocation.

    If you want to combine it with other CSS filters, make sure this
    one runs first.

    **Note**: Currently, this needs to be the very first filter
    applied. Changes by filters that ran before will be lost.
    """
    """XXX: This currently needs to be the very first filter applied. This is
    because it uses the "source filter" mechanism to support "@includes"
    in less, i.e. it let's the less compiler work directly with the source
    file, and ignores the input stream. Filters previously already applied
    will be lost. Ways to solve this:
        - Let filters specify that they need to be first (and auto do so,
          or raise an exception).
        - Rewrite the less filter:
             - It could properly use the input stream, and just create the
               temp file in the same directory as the input path.
             - It could rewrite @includes via regex, as the cssrewrite filter
               does, before passing the tempfile on to lessc.

    XXX: Depending on how less is actually used in practice, it might actually
    be a valid use case to NOT have this be a source filter, so that one can
    split the css files into various less files, referencing variables in other
    files' - without using @include, instead having them merged together by
    django-assets. This will currently not work because we compile each
    file separately, and the compiler would fail at undefined variables.
