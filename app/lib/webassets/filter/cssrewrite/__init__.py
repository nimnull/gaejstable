    """Source filter that rewrites relative urls in CSS files.

    CSS allows you to specify urls relative to the location of the CSS
    file. However, you may want to store your compressed assets in a
    different place than source files, or merge source files from
    different locations. This would then break these relative CSS
    references, since the base URL changed.

    This filter transparently rewrites CSS ``url()`` instructions
    in the source files to make them relative to the location of the
    output path. It works as a *source filter*, i.e. it is applied
    individually to each source file before they are merged.

    No configuration is necessary.

    The filter also supports a manual mode::

        get_filter('cssrewrite', replace={'old_directory', '/custom/path/'})

    This will rewrite all urls that point to files within ``old_directory``
    to use ``/custom/path`` as a prefix instead.
